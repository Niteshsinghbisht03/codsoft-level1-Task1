      <h2>Andaman and Nicobar Island</h2>
    </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character sc">A</span>ndaman and Nicobar Islands, union territory, India, consisting of two groups of islands at the southeastern edge of the Bay of Bengal. The peaks of a submerged mountain range, the Andaman Islands and their neighbours to the south, the Nicobar Islands, form an arc stretching southward for some 620 miles (1,000 km) between Myanmar (Burma) and the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. The arc constitutes the boundary between the Bay of Bengal to the west and the Andaman Sea to the east. Port Blair (on South Andaman Island) is the territorial capital.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Tourism is a growing industry in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, with dozens of hotels scattered throughout the territory. Most tourists are from the Indian mainland. Popular historical attractions include remnants of the British colonial administration, such as the Andaman Cellular Jail (completed in 1906), in Port Blair, where the Indian revolutionary Vinayak Damodar (Vir) Savarkar was detained in the first half of the 20th century. The natural environment of the territory, with its many parks, gardens, and sanctuaries, is attractive to ecotourists and trekkers.</p>

    <h2>Mumbai</h2>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character ny">M</span>umbai is the economic hub and commercial and financial centre of India. Its economic composition in some respects mirrors India’s unique mosaic of prosperity and technological achievement vis-à-vis impoverishment and underdevelopment. While Mumbai contains the Indian Atomic Energy Commission’s establishment, with its nuclear reactors and plutonium separators, many areas on the outskirts of the city continue to rely on traditional biogenic sources of fuel and energy (such as cow dung). The city is home to Reliance Industries Limited, a privately owned conglomerate that operates in petrochemical production and refining, textile, retail, telecommunications, and other industries. It became the first privately owned Indian company to enter the Fortune 500.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">The older part of Mumbai is much built-up and devoid of vegetation, but the more affluent areas, such as Malabar Hill, contain some greenery; there are a number of open playgrounds and parks. In the course of urban expansion, some residential sections of Mumbai have fallen into a state of serious disrepair, while in other areas clusters of makeshift houses (often illegal “squatter” settlements) have arisen to accommodate the city’s expanding population. Moreover, an alarming amount of air and water pollution has been generated by Mumbai’s many factories, by the growing volume of vehicular traffic, and by nearby oil refineries.</p>

    <h2>MEGHALYA FOREST</h2>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <div class="block">
    <p><span class="first-character atw">M</span>eghalaya is blanketed in lush forests, and pines, sals, and bamboo are plentiful. Other species include oak, birch, beech, and magnolia. Elephants, tigers, leopards, deer, wild pigs, gaurs (wild bison), mithan (or gayals, the domesticated form of the gaur), wolves, anteaters, monkeys, apes, squirrels, snakes, hares, and sambar deer are all found in the state. Birds in Meghalaya include peacocks, partridges, pigeons, hornbills, jungle fowls, mynas, and parrots.</p>
    <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
    <p class="margin-top-10">Meghalaya is an upland area formed by a detached block of the Deccan plateau. Its summits vary in elevation from 4,000 to 6,000 feet (1,220 to 1,830 metres). The Garo Hills in the west rise abruptly from the Brahmaputra River valley to about 1,000 feet (300 metres) and then merge with the Khasi Hills and Jaintia Hills, adjacent highland systems that form a single massif of tablelands separated by a series of eastward-trending ridges. The southern faces of the plateau, overlooking the Bangladesh lowlands, is particularly steep. Many rivers and streams flow out of the plateau, creating deep, narrow, steep-sided valleys; the most important is the Umiam-Barapani, which is the major source of hydroelectric power for Assam and Meghalaya states.</p>
